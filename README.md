# Infection
A small infection-type game I've been dabbling with.

There isn't really much to say. A while back when I used to have the Droid X2, there was a live wallpaper I had that was a map with pixelated cells that would go around and infect other cells. Some cells had the abiltiy to neutralize the bad cells but would sometimes be overwhelmed and converted. I'm just trying to emulate that but it's a lot harder than I thought it would be.

I still have the issue where the X's don't move... They should, but they aren't. I'm not sure where in my syntax I've gone wrong but it'd been pretty infuriating. After I get the X's to move, I'll work on the Resistant Cells. After those, Normal Cells.
